### Project Overview
In the pursuit of ensuring continuous improvement in the quality of education offered by our college, there is a need to systematically assess and measure the attainment of Course Outcomes (COs) and Program Outcomes (POs). This software allows administrators to manually enter data and utilize a set of performance evaluation criteria to quantitatively assess COs for each PO and Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs). A visual graph is displayed to compare the attainments for each PO and PSO.

### Project Scope
The scope of the CO PO Attainment Software includes providing a user-friendly interface for manual data entry of Course Outcomes (COs), Program Outcomes (POs), and Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs), along with performance evaluation tools to quantitatively assess these outcomes. The software features graphical visualizations for easy comparison of attainment levels, generates detailed reports for stakeholders, and incorporates feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement. Exclusions include automated data collection, advanced analytics, and integration with external systems, with a focus on user authentication and data security to ensure accurate and secure data management.
